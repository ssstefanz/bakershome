WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT SEO AND ANALYTICS
SEO encompasses a variety of methods for making a website show up higher in organic search results. This means more readers, which, in the case of nearly every website is a good thing. Organic results are ideal since they are free and generally more visited than paid search results. 

While there are a variety of ways to ensure better SEO, one I've found especially helpful is using Google Analytics to track web traffic; this way you get real-time results on who is visiting your site and why. Since I'm a journalist, and would like to take my coding skills into that arena, I'm also curious to try heatmaps to look at where site readers are spending time on a web page. 


SEO PLAN
My plan for implementing SEO on my site is as follows:
1. Hook my site up to Google Analytics, and use Google Trends to find important keywords readers might search for.
2. Fill in the meta tags for each page on the site, including title and meta description, focusing on adding keywords to optimize the search. 
3. Once the page is online, make sure it's indexed: 'site:bakershome.com'.
4. Using analytics, optimize the search results as traffic begins coming to the site. Change keywords that aren't working; update tags based on Google Trends.
